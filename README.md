github commits are restricted to 25-50 MiB, varying based on the push method [^1].

to handle files beyond this limit, git lfs (large file storage) pointers are necessary, referencing an external lfs server [^2].

however, this method incurs a monthly cloud storage fee to github [^3].

the scripts provided in this repository allow you to bypass the file size limit by committing a large file in small chunks.

## how to use

**1) split script:** ran just once, when initializing the project.

takes a large file as an argument, splits the file into smaller chunks of a specified size (50mb in this case) and stores these chunks in a temporary directory. each chunk is then pushed to a remote repository.

```bash
# chunk `huge-file.tar` and push to repository
chmod +x lfs-split.sh
./lfs-split.sh ./../huge-file.tar
```

**2) merge script:** ran on each clone.

concatenates all the chunks into a single file and checks the checksum of the merged file against the original checksum to ensure the file has not been corrupted during the whole process â†’ it is 

```bash
git clone <your-project>

# merge chunks
chmod +x lfs-merge.sh
./lfs-merge.sh

# untar merged chunks
tar -xf data-merged/merged.tar -C data-merged
rm -f data-merged/merged.tar
```
