- GitHub limits commits to 25-50 MiB.
- Larger files require Git LFS, which uses paid cloud storage.
- This script bypasses Git LFS by chunking large commits.

```
#
# upload to github
#

# compress data outside of repository
tar -czvf merged.tar.gz <huge-directory/>

# chunk and upload inside the repository
./upload.sh ./../merged.tar.gz

#
# download from github
#

# clone
git clone <https://github.com/user/project>
cd <project>

# merge chunks back together, verify checksum
./download.sh
```
